This is official code for the *Knowledge-Based Systems* full paper:  Modeling High-order Relationships and Dynamic Preferences for Group Recommendation

# Ddescription

In this paper, we explore the complex dynamics and subtle preferences of group recommendation by proposing a novel model HRDP. This model innovatively addresses the challenge of capturing the multi-granularity preferences within group dynamics through an approach that integrates synergistic multi-layer graph convolutional networks with a preference aggregation strategy. The HRDP learns from both the inherent preferences of groups and the collective preferences of their members. It effectively models both group preferences and the complex, high-order relationships and consensus among group members. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the significant improvements of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.
